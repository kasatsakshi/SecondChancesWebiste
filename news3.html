                            <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up">Here are the top 10 things going on sale in our stores this month</p>

                            <div class="clearfix my-4 mt-lg-0 mt-5">

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up"> <b>1. Dishes:</b><br><br>
                                    Our main, everyday dishes are from Ikea, but most of our other dishes - cups, serving dishes, and even crocks - are thrifted. This dish aisle is one of my favorite areas of the store because there are so many treasures to be found! At my local store I expect to pay about $0.69 for individual cups and plates, and up to $3 for larger serving dishes. It's a great way to build a beautiful, eclectic collection on a budget!
                                  </p>

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up"> <b>2. Books:</b><br><br>
                                    Probably 90% of the books on our shelves were bought second hand - either at thrift stores or yard sales. I've actually had to rethink my book-buying habits because it turns out there is such a thing as too many books. Or at least, too many books for our bookshelves. So I've stopped buying everything that catches my eye and I'm focusing more on quality hardback copies of really good books. My local thrift store usually has a great book selection! I typically pay $0.69 for children's books and $2.50 for chapter books at Goodwill.
                                  </p>

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up"> <b>3. Baskets:</b><br><br>
                                    I never pass up the basket aisle. It can be hit or miss depending on the day, but there is usually a decent selection and I've found some great baskets over the years! I usually pay $1-2 per basket.
                                  </p>

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up"> <b>4. Art:</b><br><br>
                                    The art section is a great place to search for hidden gems like this original oil painting - one of my all-time favorite finds! Plus it's a regular old treasure trove if you're looking for picture frames - don't be afraid to buy an ugly piece of art just to get its frame. Locally I expect to pay $3-4 for a painting (I think this one was $4) or framed art, and about $2 for an empty frame. You can build an entire gallery wall for a great price!
                                  </p>

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up"> <b>5. Furniture:</b><br><br>
                                    With a careful eye, you can find some insane furniture deals at the thrift store! I'm always on the lookout for a great dresser, vintage cabinets, and wooden chairs. You do have to be a bit careful in the furniture section, though, because there are often broken or cheaply-made pieces that aren't worth buying, even at thrift store prices. I look for solid wood pieces in decent condition (I don't mind a few minor repairs for a quality piece) with good bones. Remember, anything can be painted so don't let a bad color distract you from the prize! Our dining chairs, desk, and some of our dressers (this one and this one) were all second hand! Prices vary greatly and sometimes they nice wood pieces are even cheaper than their particle board cousins. So keep your eyes open and snatch up a deal if you see one!
                                  </p>

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up"> <b>6. Sheets:</b><br><br>
                                    Specifically large floral flat sheets. I keep a collection of them in our closet because they are perfect for building blanket forts, picnics, and all kinds of pretend play. They are lightweight and easy to carry, plus they don't take up much space to store! And it's a total bonus that they're so pretty. I've paid $1-2 per sheet.  

                                    I'm also keeping an eye out for wool blankets we can use for camping. I haven't found any yet. But I'm ever a thrift-store-optimist.
                                  </p>

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up"> <b>7. Home Decor:</b><br><br>
                                    I've become much more careful this year about what I bring into my home, especially when it comes to decor. No more thoughtless clutter, thankyouverymuch. (read more about our shopping ban + spending freeze here) But with a careful eye you can find all sorts of beautiful and unique pieces for amazing prices. I have found some of my favorite decor second-hand! Deocr items are typically $1-2 locally. Which I'm just now realizing is the price range for almost everything I've bought there. Do they only have two price sticker options and just price everything with them? My gut says "yes."
                                  </p>

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up"> <b>8. Storage Items:</b><br><br>
                                    When I need to organize something, I love to start at the thrift store. Especially in my beloved basket aisle. But with everything from baskets to shelving to drawer organizers, you never know what you'll find! Two of my very favorite items to hunt for at the thrift store are vintage wooden accordion hat racks (great for hanging anything from purses to jackets to umbrellas!) and knick-knack shelves or printer's drawers that we use as treasure shelves to display all the little goodies the boys collect:
                                  </p>

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up"> <b>9. Clothes:</b><br><br>
                                    Especially boy's clothes. I don't usually take the time to dig through the women's clothes - I've learned over the last year or so that I'm kind of a clothes minimalist. I know what I like and for most things I'd rather pay the extra to get exactly what I want new without searching and trying things on.
                                  </p>

                                  <p data-aos="fade-up"> <b>10. Lamps:</b><br><br>
                                    I love thrifted lamps. Almost every lamp in my home is thrifted, and I actually have my eye on another I'm hoping to go back for on half-price day! My favorites so far are my bedroom sconces, a desk lamp (it was a brand new $50 lamp for $5!), and our dining room chandelier. Just plug them in first to make sure they work (our store has an outlet buy the lamp shelf for testing them) but most of the lamps are there just because they are outdated or unwanted, even though they work perfectly
                                  </p>
